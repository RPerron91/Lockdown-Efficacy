Proposal:

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has forced many countries into lockdown. To see how necessary lockdowns are to the containment of a pandemic we can use two different tests to see if there is a correlation between implementing lockdowns and average rate of death by the virus. To test for a statistically significant correlation, we would compare countries just before the lockdown period to just after their lockdown period (factoring in the incubation period to know when the effects of the lockdown procedures would be felt).

The hypothesis: lockdowns statistically significantly decrease the average rate of death of countries affected by Covid-19 and the data should be non-normally distributed because of the exponential nature of the virus. To test for statistical significance, we will be comparing means, so the null hypothesis is that the median difference between pairs of observations (deaths over time while under lockdown vs not under lockdown) is zero.

This research would be most insightful for any governing body in deciding which precautions should be considered when combating a pandemic (or at least mitigating the casualties in the situation). If there is indeed a statistically significant relationship between implementing any form of lockdown, it can be assumed continuing or enforcing stricter lockdowns would further contain the spread of the virus and continue to decrease the average death rate in countries afflicted by Covid-19.
