Proposal:

Given datasets of covid 19 testing and death rate, the effectiveness of lockdowns decreasing the average rate of death in countries afflicted by Covid-19 can be A/B tested. Countries who have locked down can be compared against countries who haven't to see if implementing a lockdown actually has a statistically significant correlation with death rate. 

The hypothesis: lockdowns statistically significantly decrease the average rate of death of countries affected by Covid-19. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant relationship in the implementation of a lockdown on the average death rate of those countries.

This research would be most insightful for any governing body in deciding which precautions should be considered when combating a pandemic (or at least mitigating the casualties in the situation). If there is indeed a statistically significant relationship between implementing any form of lockdown, it can be assumed continuing or enforcing stricter lockdowns would further contain the spread of the virus and continue to decrease the average death rate in countries afflicted by Covid-19.
